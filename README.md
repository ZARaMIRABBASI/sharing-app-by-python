# sharing-app-by-python
Iam writing an app for sharing files cross the systems using a server and python language 
here's the way to run it on your own system:
Run the server:
    First, run the server code. Note that you must run the server on a public network or the Internet and open the appropriate port.
    Run the client: Then run the client code and enter the IP address of the server. Select the desired file to send.

Important points

    Firewall Port: Make sure port 5001 (or whatever port you have chosen) is open on your firewall for communication.
    Public IP Address: If you are running the server on a router, you may need to configure NAT to route requests to your server.
    Security: This code is suitable for testing and learning, but for use in production environments, you need to consider security and validation.
